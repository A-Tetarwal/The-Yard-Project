# Title: "Yard: Organizing the Unorganized Junk Collection Sector"

# Abstract:
# Yard aims to revolutionize the unorganized junk collection system by establishing a structured and efficient process for collecting, segregating, and recycling waste materials. Starting on a small scale within a designated city area, we will connect local residents with assigned junk collectors, providing an easy and accessible way to dispose of their recyclables. The collected waste will be sorted into categories at our recycling centers and then sent to factories for processing. If successful, we plan to expand our operations through an online platform and modernize waste collection for widespread community benefits.
